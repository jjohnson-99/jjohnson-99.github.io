        The bulk of my graduate work is loosly on <b>completing partially supplied
            data sets</b>. This is exceptionally important to fields like biology and
        medicine where data is costly and difficult to come by, e.g., drug discovery
        research. This is also important to commerce, e.g., the <a class="bodyLink", 
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize", target="_blank"> 
            Netflix problem</a>. I have worked on developing new algorithms
        to solve certain instances of this problem. Additionally, I have worked
        on theory that attempts to understand the mathematical limits of a certain
        special case.

        In mathematics, this problem is refered to as <b> matrix completion</b>.
        In order to describe this, let us divide the problem into two classes, the first
        and simplist being <b> low-rank matrix completion</b> (LRMC). In LRMC,
        there is an $m\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{X}$ of a given rank $r$, however,
        we are able to view only a subset of entries, denoted by a mask $\Omega$,
        a matrix of 1's and 0's where 1 denotes the location of an observed 
        entry and 0 denotes otherwise. This observed matrix is denoted by
        $X^{\Omega}$. For example, we may be given
        $$
        X^{\Omega} = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 2 & \ast\\
            \ast & 6 & 3\\
            \end{bmatrix},
            \qquad \text{where} \qquad
           \Omega =  \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 1 & 0\\
            0 & 1 & 1\\
            \end{bmatrix}.
        $$
        The question now is, what should the missing values of $X$ be? The
        answer to this depends on the value of the assumed rank $r$, i.e., if
        the rank is assumed to be 2, the missing entries can be any value. If
        we assume, however, that the rank should be 1, then it is possible to
        show that $X$ must be precisely
        $$
        X = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 1\\
        3 & 6 & 3\\
        \end{bmatrix}.
        $$
        This is prehaps not surprising since the number of equations that must
        be satisfied by $X$ is small and easy to solve by hand. If the values of
        $m$, $n$, and $r$ are large, and the percent of missing data moderate 
        to large, the problem is infeasible to solve by hand and algorithms
        must be developed to find or approximate the answer. There already
        exist many algorithms to do this. My research on LRMC was rather focused
        on which patterns $\Omega$ lead to partially observed data $X^{\Omega}$
        with a finite number of solutions, as in the example above. This question
        is linked to the very difficult problem in algebraic combinatorics of
        characterizing the bases of the algebraic matroid of determinental varities.
        Many attempts at solving this problem have been made.
